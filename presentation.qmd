## What I am going to talk about

- Experience as a participant
- Data analysis

<!-- my participation in the project started in
august 2024
I've got a history of working on community science projects
so it was very easy for me to be interested in in
I had also been participating in a couple of other 
crowdcoursed co2 projects and I was a bit frustrated with 
the way they worked
manual recordings were slow and unreliable
also not really open source - I wanted to be able 
to build on the data and draw conclusions

this project seemed to solve a lot of those issues
 -->

## Experience as a participant

<!-- video of doing a measurement
pretty easy but a little unintuitive
if you want to do a lot of measurements you 
can do up to 12 an hour, but 9 or 10 is the real limit
 -->

## Walkthrough of a measurement

<!-- most users
power users
can do about 9 or 10 per hour -->

<!-- deets:

We are going to use Youtube live. The tricky bit is getting our webcams synced up
We will investigate.
1st feb 19:00 Berlin time
40 mins presentation + 20 for questions

We should find someone or sometwo to moderate the chat and compile questions

Adgenda:
Aurel introduce everything
Sam will talk about the ux and how I usually use it
Then Sam can talk about visualizations and the R package
Aurel conclude stuff

A few days before, we will have a quick look at each other's stuff 
and make sure we know what the other is talking about
Thursday evening we will check webcams and fix problems -->
